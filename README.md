# üìó JavaScript Learning

This repository contains a curated collection of JavaScript practice projects and code experiments. Each folder focuses on a specific topic or concept, ranging from basic syntax to modern tooling like Vite and Webpack.

The goal is to reinforce understanding through hands-on coding, with examples that can run in the browser or with Node.js.
